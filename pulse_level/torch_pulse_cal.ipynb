    "Below we define functions defining our way of parametrizing the custom gate we intend to calibrate. In the pulse gate scenario, we define two functions for clearly separating the abstraction layers that are intertwined here.\n",
    "The function ```apply_parametrized_circuit``` creates a custom parametrized ```Gate``` (which can be derived from a predefined Qiskit gate to retrieve its logical effect) and appends it to a ```QuantumCircuit``` given in input. The parametrization of the gate is provided by the ```params: ParameterVector``` argument of the function and is used to build a custom calibration of the gate. This custom calibration is defined in the second function called ```custom_schedule```, which builds a custom parametrized pulse schedule that can be attached to the gate calibration (see this tutorial for more info: https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/05_pulse_gates.html).\n",
    "In our approach, we design a custom schedule starting from the baseline calibration already available from IBMQ calibration results. The parameters of our custom schedule are in this framework deviations over baseline parameters of the original calibration, meant to evolve to address the particular circuit context in which the gate is going to be executed."

The more observables we provide for sampling, the more properties we are able to deduce with accuracy about the actual state that was created when applying our custom controls. For a single qubit, the possible Pauli operators are $\\sigma_0=I$, $\\sigma_x=X$, $\\sigma_y=Y$, $\\sigma_z=Z$. For a general multiqubit system, the Pauli observables are tensor products of those single qubit Pauli operators. The algorithm will automatically estimate which observables are the most relevant to sample based on the provided target. The probability distribution from which those observables are sampled is derived from the Direct Fidelity Estimation (equation 3, https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.230501) algorithm. \n",

    "- ```estimator_options```: Options of the Qiskit Estimator primitive. The Estimator is the Qiskit module enabling an easy computation of Pauli expectation values. One can set options to make this process more reliable (typically by doing some error mitigation techniques in post-processing). Works only with Runtime Backend at the moment\n",

One can choose here to stick to the usual circuit model of quantum computing, by using the ```QuantumCircuit``` objects from Qiskit and therefore set the ```abstraction_level``` to ```\\\"circuit\\\"```. However, depending on the task at hand, one can also prefer to use a pulse description of all the operations in our circuit. This is possible for both real backends and simulators by using respectively Qiskit Runtime and Qiskit Dynamics. In this case, one should define the ansatz circuit above in a pulse level fashion, and the simulation done at the Hamiltonian level, and not only via statevector calculations. In this notebook we set the ```abstraction_level``` to ```\\\"pulse\\\"```. Another notebook at the gate level is available in the repo."

Note that the class will automatically look for all instances of the gate within the circuit and build dedicated subcircuits (truncations) enabling the successive calibration of each gate instance. To be noted here: the gate calibration focuses only on the target qubits defined in the ```QuantumEnvironment```. In Qiskit, we typically look for the ```CircuitInstruction``` object composed of a ```Gate``` object and a set of target qubits on which the gate is applied (both defined in target).\n",

In the real-time use case, we would like the agent to generate on the fly random actions that will be applied directly for the next gate within the circuit execution.
