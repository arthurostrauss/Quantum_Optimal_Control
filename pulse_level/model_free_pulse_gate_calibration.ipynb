    "The algorithm is built upon Qiskit modules. To specify how to address our quantum system of interest, we therefore adopt the IBM approach to define a quantum backend, on which qubits are defined and can be accessed via control actions and measurements.\n",

    "- ```qubit_tgt_register```: List of qubit indices which are specifically addressed by controls , namely the ones for which we intend to calibrate a gate upon or steer them in a specific quantum state. Note that this list could include less qubits than the total number of qubits, which can be useful when one wants to take into account crosstalk effects emerging from nearest-neigbor coupling.\n",
    "- ```sampling_Paulis```: number of Pauli observables  to be sampled from the system: the algorithm relies on the ability to process measurement outcomes to estimate the expectation value of different Pauli operators. The more observables we provide for sampling, the more properties we are able to deduce with accuracy about the actual state that was created when applying our custom controls. For a single qubit, the possible Pauli operators are $\\sigma_0=I$, $\\sigma_x=X$, $\\sigma_y=Y$, $\\sigma_z=Z$. For a general multiqubit system, the Pauli observables are tensor products of those single qubit Pauli operators. The algorithm will automatically estimate which observables are the most relevant to sample based on the provided target. The probability distribution from which those observables are sampled is derived from the Direct Fidelity Estimation (equation 3, https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.230501) algorithm. \n",
    "- ```N_shots```: Indicates how many measurements shall be done for each provided circuit (that is a specific combination of an action vector and a Pauli observable to be sampled)\n",
    "- The dimension of the action vector: Indicates the number of pulse/circuit parameters that characterize our parametrized quantum circuit.\n",
    "- ```estimator_options```: Options of the Qiskit Estimator primitive. The Estimator is the Qiskit module enabling an easy computation of Pauli expectation values. One can set options to make this process more reliable (typically by doing some error mitigation techniques in post-processing). Works only with Runtime Backend at the moment\n",
    "- ```abstraction_level``` chosen to encode our quantum circuit. One can choose here to stick to the usual circuit model of quantum computing, by using the ```QuantumCircuit``` objects from Qiskit and therefore set the ```abstraction_level``` to ```\"circuit\"```. However, depending on the task at hand, one can also prefer to use a pulse description of all the operations in our circuit. This is possible by using resources of another module of Qiskit called Qiskit Dynamics. In this case, one should define the ansatz circuit above in a pulse level fashion, and the simulation done at the Hamiltonian level, and not only via statevector calculations. In this notebook we set the ```abstraction_level``` to ```\"pulse\"```. Another notebook at the gate level is available in the repo."

To ensure a correlation between the average reward computed from the measurement outcomes and the average gate fidelity, the provided set of input states must be tomographically complete. Note that providing the set of ```input_states```as depicted below is optional and should be done only if you have a specific set to implement, by default it is internally set to the Pauli basis preparation stage.\n",

The register can be a list of indices for qubits to be addressed in the circuit, or a ```QuantumRegister```object. If register is not provided, then by default the target register will be the list of all qubits defined up to ```Gate().num_qubits```."
