    "- Hybrid Jobs combine classical and quantum compute resources for running algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These hybrid quantum-classical algorithms optimize the performance of available quantum devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They aim to maximize benefits and minimize drawbacks of both computational systems.\n",
    "- Typically used for finding the ground state or global minimum of a system.\n",
    "- Hybrid Jobs can be submitted to any quantum processing unit (QPU) or quantum simulator.\n",
    "- Submission involves defining the algorithm via a Python script and configuring input data or hyperparameters.\n",
    "- The script, input data, and hyperparameters collectively define the job's environment.\n",
    "- This environment is encapsulated within a container, which is accessed by the Hybrid Job after submission."

    "### Performance\n",
    "- Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs offer better performance compared to running hybrid algorithms in your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jobs have priority access to the chosen quantum processing unit (QPU), resulting in shorter and more predictable runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports parametric compilation, allowing circuit compilation with free parameters for faster subsequent parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convenience\n",
    "- Simplifies setup and management of your compute environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You provide the algorithm script and select the quantum device, and Amazon Braket handles the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It waits for the target device, provisions classical resources, runs the workload in pre-built containers, stores results in Amazon S3, and releases compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "- Provides real-time insights into running algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delivers customizable algorithm metrics to Amazon CloudWatch and the Amazon Braket console.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enables tracking of algorithm progress in near real-time."
